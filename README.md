StreetCrime: A Generative Science Approach
According to data from 2019, Milan emerged as the foremost city in Italy in terms of reported robberies and pickpocketings. Anecdotal evidence of the city being perceived as unsafe has become increasingly prevalent on various social media platforms. This situation raises questions within the realm of social sciences regarding the development of effective crime reduction strategies. One of the most effective approaches involves the ability to predict when and where crimes are likely to occur. However, creating a machine learning model for this purpose is often a formidable challenge, as criminal data tends to be incomplete, difficult to access, or ethically sensitive. In response to these challenges, this thesis adopts an alternative perspective by delving into an old yet recently revitalized methodology within the social sciences: Agent-Based Modeling (ABM). Urban crime presents indeed an ideal environment for the application of ABM due to its reliance on local interactions among agents within a specified spatial context. The thesis commences with an exploration of the foundations of generative social science and the historical evolution of ABM. It then delves into a comprehensive review of criminological theories, empirical literature, and prior ABMs, with the aim of creating a model that aligns with current research on urban crime. Subsequently, the thesis follows on an empirical exploration of real-world crime data. With the addition of environmental data, the model is specified and tested through short-run and long-run iterations. The evaluation process encompasses various dimensions, including external empirical validity, empirical validation, and statistical conclusion validity. Finally, the thesis concludes with an examination of the model's performance and outlines directions for future research expansion. ​ ​
